# Project Todos

This week's project was to build a To-do app in react and redux toolkit.
I used mostly styled components and some vanilla css for bigger styling parts.

## My work

I started to plan my project in Figma. Then I decided on what components I would need and how to structure my work. These were the requirements for the application:
List all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
It should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
It should be able to add and remove tasks
The app should show a count of either all todos or all uncomplete todos (or both)
I also added:
A timestamp for when the task is created (or updated)
A complete button to set all tasks completed.
A delete button to delete all tasks.
A no todos added page.
Other things I would like to add when I have the time would be local storage and categories for the tasks.
